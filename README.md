# üë®‚Äçüíª Camz

## Hello folks

I‚Äôm Camil an EPITA last year student, and I‚Äôve got a habit of diving into projects that are half science, half experiment. My current obsession? Trying to read numbers from EEG signals. It‚Äôs a mix of weirdness and discovery that keeps me hooked, and I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. Hackathons are where I feel at home‚Äîsomething about building wild ideas in no time just clicks with me

## üöÄ Projects

### üß† **[EEG MNIST MindBigData](http://google.com)**
Currently building ...
- **Description**:  Developing a model to predict handwritten digit classifications from EEG signals, effectively combining neural data with classic MNIST image recognition for an innovative approach to mind-to-number interpretation.
- **Technologies**: ![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PyTorch-EE4C2C?&logo=PyTorch&logoColor=white)

### üåü **[Echo: Memory Support Platform for Alzheimer's]()**
- **Description**: Echo helps support loved ones with Alzheimer's by creating a shared album. Family members can post souvenirs,  pictures, and comments. Echo features an AI-powered chatbot for retrieving past posts and personalized memory quizzes using üë§üîç (face recognition) and üé≤ Thompson sampling, ensuring an adaptive quiz experience.

- **How We Built It**: Built with React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend). The app has three main interfaces for data handling, chatbot interactions, and quiz generation using Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation for better memory retention.
